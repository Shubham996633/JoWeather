Today the time has come to accept that I am leaving my house for the studies this is a very hard to do for me as a introvert child I never used to go 
any where such likes that and not coming to home for 3 hours is a big deal but now the scenerio demands to leave the house where I feel the safe from this
world and to get escape from the comfort of my parent under whom I never feel to any discomfort and now the life demands that , This will be not easy to do 
so as my dude when he had leaved the house I had seen the situation of my parent they also not easily accepted that as they also dosent live without not having
us in the home , I pray the god and my belief please give support to my mummy and papa as this will be also not easy for them to and mine is very hard to do
I had one more thing that I spent most time and feelings is that my PC all my work is done and possible by only my PC, as outside when I go the work got 
shatttered and but when done by my PC is done and this has remove my bad habits and give me the life of hope and joy from the life of sick and make me 
a person that have a lots of control and make me a human from a zombie and give the real music power.

My PC is one who knows all my feelings and pain and always I used to tell my all feelings to my PC and this never argue with me understand me and even show 
the real path to follow , its a second guardian after my parents this is a teacher , a best friend and all the life mentor all I had achived is by him and 
my parents and dude.

To such a condition is not easy just hoping almighty will help both me and my parents to overcome the grief of seperation , I had collected all photos of
what I had needed



Promise : I Promise that I never ever get that road again from where my PC has bought me to right road , and one day as soon as possible make the day when
          my parents will say the shubham is coming my child with a proud of parents of successful person , I never ever got distracted and I will be focused
          to my work and life, and not going to take a rest for a while until I am able to make the day for my parents.
